# PolitiCash

<b>NOTE: This app currently only works for members of the 114th Congress.</b> The APIs that this app relies on have not yet updated to reflect the current Congress, and this app WILL CRASH if you try to view financial information on newly elected representatives :(

It's no secret -- money affects politics. Find out which individuals, industries, and special interest groups are 
bankrolling your representatives. Created using HTML/CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

This app is not a deep research tool. Instead, it is intended to make political data more
visual and easily-accessible.
